ps: any array can be regarded as a string

## Goal:

Transfer logical concepts to adt that computer can recognize. 

First transfer something to data(generation strings).

Redefine logical concepts.

## Computation: strings to strings

Defination: change the string in the memory .

Matrix: restore strings by colume or row .

## Computer science 

#### Fundamental problem 

1. identify computable problem.(algorithm)
2. evaluate time/space complexity.(efficiency)

Automatic: Fetch instructions and run it .

#### Branches: 

* Picture processing 
* Artifical intelligence 



Picture :Data from the reality by sensor

Graph:Data produced by computer

## automata

Defination: automata is the mathematical model of computer

Computability or decidability

Complexity or intractability

## Baysiam formular

## Finite Automation

* a finite amount of information

*  information represented by **state** 

* state changes by **inputs**

* Rules that tells about how the state changes in response to inputs are called **transitions**
