Figure 4.2, where I-Mem, Add, Mux, ALU, Regs, D-Mem, and Control blocks have
latencies of 400 ps, 100 ps, 30 ps, 120 ps, 200 ps, 350 ps, and 100 ps, respectively,
and costs of 1000, 30, 10, 100, 200, 2000, and 500, respectively.

###### 4.31

Before: I-Mem+ Add+Regs+Mux+ALU + D-Mem + Mux + Regs =1130;

After : Before+300 =1430

###### 4.32

Speedup achieved = $\frac{1130}{1430*0.95}=0.83$

4.33

Before: $1000 + 2*30+ 3*10+ 100+ 200+ 2000+ 500=3890$;

After:$1000 + 2*30+ 3*10+ 100+ 200+ 2000+ 500+600=4490$;

Relative Cost: $4490/3890 =􏳣 1.15$;

Relative Cost / Speedup = 1.39;

#### 4.4

###### 4.41

I-mem 200 ps

###### 4.42

| I-mem | Add  | Mux  | ALU  | Regs | D-Mem | Sign-Extend | Shift-Left-2 |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 200ps | 70ps | 20ps | 90ps | 90ps | 250ps | 15ps        | 10ps         |

I-mem+sign-extend + sign-left-2+Add+Mux =315ps

###### 4.43

I-mem+Regs + mux+ALU+mux =420 ps

###### 4.44

PC-relative branches.  All except jump

###### 4.45

None,since every instructions don't have to need the branches.

###### 4.46

The clock time is determined by the longest path of instructions,Since the path of beq is longer than add, So we need only to think about the add instruction.

uncontional PC-relative path is about 305+10 ps;

And the contional PC-relative path is about 420 ps;

So the lattice of this resource should be increased by 420-305 =105 ps or more to influence the clock time;
